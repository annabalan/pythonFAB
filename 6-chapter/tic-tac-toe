  Welcome to the greatest intellectual challenge of all time: Tic-Tac_Toe.
  This will be a showdown between your human brain and my silicon processor.

  You will make your move known by entering a number, 0 - 8. The number
  will correspond to the board position as illustrated:

             0 | 1 | 2
            ___________
             3 | 4 | 5
            ___________
             6 | 7 | 8

  Prepare yourself, human. The ultimate battle is about to begin.|n
